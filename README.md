# The Odin Project - Ruby Projects
In this repository I'll push all the ruby scripts I will write as a solution to the projects in the Ruby course

<li>
  <h3>Caesar cipher</h3>
  <p>This is the first project and it's an implementation of the Caesar cipher. Below you can find two snippets of the input and the output. Both crypt and decrypt.</p>

  <h3>Sub strings</h3>
  <p>In this second project, the object is to implement the method substring such that it receives a phrase and a dictionary(an array) and it'll 
  output an hash containing all the words of the dictionary that are included in the phrase. The hash also contains the number of time each word 
  is used in the phrase.

  Below ther's the snippet code with the method being called and it's output.</p>

  <h3>Stock picker</h3>
  <p>In this project, the method I had to implement was about searching the best day to buy and sell a stock, given an array with the daily prices of a stock. One thing I had to to pay attention to is that before selling I should check if previously I've bought that stock.</p>
  Below ther's the snippet code with the method being called and it's output.</p>
