In this repository I'll push all the ruby scripts I will write as a solution to the projects in the Ruby course

  <h3>Sub strings</h3>
  <p>In this second project, the object is to implement the method substring such that it receives a phrase and a dictionary(an array) and it'll 
  output an hash containing all the words of the dictionary that are included in the phrase. The hash also contains the number of time each word 
  is used in the phrase. /
  Below ther's the snippet code with the method being called and it's output.</p>
